/**
 * A translator that accepts an English word and prints to the console 
 * the equivalent word that results from transformation under the rules
 * of Pig Latin.  Words are transformed according to one of three patterns:
 * 
 * for initial consonants, move the leading consonant to the end and add "ay"
 * for initial blends, move the blend to the end and add "ay"
 * for initial vowels, simply add "way" to the end of the word
 * 
 * Ex. 
 * 		"happy" should print "appyhay"
 * 		"trap" should print "aptray"
 * 		"egg" should print "eggway"
